    "# Solar Panel Dust Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been a tremendous growth in the use of solar panels as a form of generating electricity. Many industries are moving towards clean and renewable energy sources with one of them primarily from solar cells. In order for them to produce electricity with maximum efficiency, there is a higher need for regular maintenance. \n",
    "\n",
    "With data science and machine learning, it is possible to detect the dust accumulated in solar panels, ensuring that there is timely maintenance and improvement in accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle. It contains a list of images of solar panels that are clean and dusty in different directories. Below is the link to the repository where there is a detailed description of the images and the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hemanthsai7/solar-panel-dust-detection\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we are considering is quite balanced as there are equal number of images of clean and dusty solar panels. Therefore, we can use accuracy along with other metrics to evaluate the performance of deep learning models. \n",

    "1. Accuracy\n",
    "2. Precision\n",
    "3. Recall\n",
    "4. F1-Score\n",
    "5. AUC Score\n",
